# Examify: Statement of Work

## Purpose

Client <Math Teacher> of Fake High School, Somewhere BFE, is seeking assistance from provider, Sean Ross, an independent contractor in developing a piece of software. The purpose of this contracted project is to create a software tool that can generate electronic exams from documents and provide students with an accurate assessment of their performance. The software will allow instructors to easily create and customize exams in a variety of formats, including multiple-choice, short answer, and essay questions. The input document will be scanned by the software and converted into an electronic exam format, with questions and answer choices automatically extracted and formatted. Once students complete the exam, the software will analyze their responses and provide an overall grade, as well as individual feedback on each question. The goal of this project is to provide a fast, efficient, and accurate way for instructors to create and grade exams, while also providing students with a comprehensive assessment of their performance.

## Scope of Work

Code will be appended to the GitHub project (\<https://github.com/spross216/FinalProject>) via a push from Provider's Local Repository. The provider will transfer all documentation, source code and any other additional documents deemed useful to the above listed repository.
Deliverables will be transfered no later than EOB 20 March, 2023. If for whatever reason the provider is unable to meet this deadline, it is the provider's responsibility to communicate this need to the client so that an extension can be agreed upon in good will. 

## Deliverables

- a `GUI` class will be used to organize the code imported from the tkinter library to design the interface, for better readability and leaving the possibility open for future extension of the software
- The logic will be separated from the gui components and written in a more modular functional style for better readability, testability and extensability, though the algorythms are TBD
- the rest of the deliverables are TBD pending more research, and will be updated here as the project develops

## Timeline

The provider will document the process in this field as the software is being developed:
- **Friday, 24th February, 2023**: Began researching tkinter, and prototyped basic GUI applications to get more familiar with the library

## Compensation

Compensation from the client to the provider will be in the form of a one-time payment at the end of the project. Compensation of a week supply of :fire:Ramen Noodles and Mountain Dew:fire: :yum: delivered upon completion and transference of deliverables.
